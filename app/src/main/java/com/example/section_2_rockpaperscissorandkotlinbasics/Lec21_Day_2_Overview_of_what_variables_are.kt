*    to reserve a specific amount memory space for that variable (data)
*    based on the data types selected.
* 3. How much space to be reserved is handled kotlin.
* 4. Once a variable is created a value can be assigened or
*    changed through lifecycle of app or retrieve the value.
* 5. Variable only exists when the app is open, once app is closed
*    the variable stop existing and has no value anymore.

*    taken by specific type of data is take care of by kotlin.
