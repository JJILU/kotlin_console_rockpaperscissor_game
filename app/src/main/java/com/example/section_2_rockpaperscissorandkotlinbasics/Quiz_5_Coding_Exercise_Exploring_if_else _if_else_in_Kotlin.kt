/**
 * Coding Exercise - Exploring "if-else if-else" in Kotlin
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 * Quiz 5|7 questions
 * ------------------
 * In this coding exercise, we will be focusing on the
 * "if-else if-else" chains. These chains allow for more
 * comprehensive decision-making in our programs.
 * Ready to master this essential tool? Let's dive in!
 *
 *
 *
 * Question 1:
 * ------------
 * Setting up the Playground:
 *---------------------------
 * Start by creating a new Kotlin file named "AgeControl.kt".
 *
 *
 * Question 2:
 * -----------
 * Step 1: Basic Age Verification
 * -------------------------------
 * Prompt the user to enter their age using
 * print("Enter your age as a whole number: ").
 * Store the entered age as an Int variable named age.
 * Use an if statement to check if the age is greater than
 * or equal to 18. If true, print "You can enter the club.".
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Question 3:
 * ----------
 * Step 2: Incorporating "else if"
 * ------------------------------
 * Extend your if statement from the previous step.
 * Add an else if condition to check if the age is greater than or equal to 40.
 * If this condition is met, print "You cannot go into the club, please go home.".
 * Hint: Always remember the sequence matters! Code is executed from top to bottom.
 *
 *Question 4:
 *----------
 * Step 3: Adding an "else" Clause
 *--------------------------------
 * Conclude your "if-else if" chain by adding an else clause.
 * In this clause, print "Age not verified. Please contact support.".
 *
 *
 * Question 5:
 * -----------
 * Step 4: Combining Conditions
 *-----------------------------
 * Update your initial if condition to check two things:
 * The age is greater than or equal to 18.The age is less than 40.
 * Hint: Use the && operator to combine these conditions.
 *
 *
 * Question 6:
 * ----------
 * Step 5: Using Range Checks
 * -----------------------------
 * Refactor your code to replace the combined conditions from Step 4 with a range check.
 * Use the in keyword to check if the age is within the range of 18 to 39 (inclusive).
 * Hint: The syntax for a range is startValue..endValue.
 *
 *
 * Question 7:
 * -----------
 * Final Step
 *----------
 * Bravo! You've deepened your understanding of Kotlin'
 * control flow mechanisms, particularly "if-else if-else" chains.
 * These structures are essential for creating versatile and dynamic programs.
 * Compile your code, ensuring it runs without errors, and share your final code
 * in the course discussion or as directed by the instructor. Feel free to discuss
 * your approach, any challenges you faced, or possible enhancements.
 *
 * Good luck with the rest of the course!
