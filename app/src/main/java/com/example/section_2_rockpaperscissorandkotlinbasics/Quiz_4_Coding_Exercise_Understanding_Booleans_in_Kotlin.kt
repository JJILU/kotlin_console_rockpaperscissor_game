/**
 * Coding Exercise - Understanding Booleans in Kotlin
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * Quiz 4|7 questions
 * Using this coding exercise, you will reinforce your
 * understanding of boolean data types and logical operations,
 * making you better prepared for our upcoming Rock-Paper-Scissors application!
 *
 *
 * Question 1:
 * -----------
 * Setting up the Playground:
 *--------------------------
 * Start by creating a new Kotlin file named "BooleansPractice.kt".
 * Make sure to clear any pre-existing code.
 *
 *
 *Question 2:
 *-----------
 * Step 1: Declaring Boolean Variables
 *------------------------------------
 * Declare a variable named myTrue and assign the value true to it.
 * Similarly, declare a variable named myFalse and assign the value false to it.
 * Hint: Remember that the words 'true' and 'false' are special keywords in Kotlin.
 *
 *Question 3:
 *-----------
 * Step 2: Logical OR Operation
 * -----------------------------
  Using the println function, evaluate the OR
  operation between myTrue and myFalse. Observe the output.
 Hint: Use the || symbol for the OR operation. For instance,
 if either of the two booleans is true, then the result will be true.
 *
 *
 *
 * Question 4:
 * -----------
 * Step 3: Logical AND Operation
 *------------------------------
 * Use the println function again, but this time,
 * evaluate the AND operation between myTrue and myFalse.
 *Hint: Use the && symbol for the AND operation.
 *The result will be true only if both the booleans are true.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Question 5:
 * -----------
 * Step 4: Logical NOT Operation
 * -----------------------------
 * Lastly, print the negation of myTrue.
 * Hint: Use the ! symbol to negate the boolean value.
 *
 *
 *
 * Question 6:
 * -----------
 * Step 5: Understanding Inline Comments
 *--------------------------------------
 * Add inline comments next to each of your println statements,
 * predicting the output. For example: // This will be true
 * Hint: Inline comments in Kotlin start with double slashes // and won't be executed by the compiler.
 *
 *
 *
 * Question 7:
 * ----------
 * Final Step
 *------------
 * Congratulations! You've practiced using boolean data types and
 * their associated logical operations in Kotlin. As a reminder,
 * booleans are essential in programming, especially in conditions and decision-making.
 *
 * Compile your code that includes all the steps from the exercise.
 * Ensure it runs without errors, and then share your final code in
 * the course discussion or as directed by the instructor.
 * Observational comments using inline comments are encouraged!
